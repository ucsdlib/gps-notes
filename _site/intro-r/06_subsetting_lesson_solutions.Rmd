## Solution to challenge 2

**A and C are correct.**

The `which` command returns the index of every `TRUE` value in its
input. The `names(x) == "g"` command didn't return any `TRUE` values. Because
there were no `TRUE` values passed to the `which` command, it returned an
empty vector. Negating this vector with the minus sign didn't change its
meaning. Because we used this empty vector to retrieve values from `x`, it
produced an empty numeric vector. It was a `named numeric` empty vector
because the vector type of x is "named numeric" since we assigned names to the
values (try `str(x)` ).

## Solution to challenge 7

Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

1. Extract observations collected for the year 1957

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   # gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
   gapminder[gapminder$year == 1957,]
```

2. Extract all columns except 1 through to 4

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   # gapminder[,-1:4]
   gapminder[,-c(1:4)]
```

3. Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer the 80 years

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   # gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80]
   gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80,]
```

4. Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns
  (`lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   # gapminder[1, 4, 5]
   gapminder[1, c(4, 5)]
```

5. Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002 and 2007

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    # gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | 2007,]
    gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | gapminder$year == 2007,]
    gapminder[gapminder$year %in% c(2002, 2007),]
```

## Solution to challenge 8

1.  `gapminder` is a data.frame so needs to be subsetted on two dimensions. `gapminder[1:20, ]` subsets the data to give the first 20 rows and all columns.

2. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder_small <- gapminder[c(1:9, 19:23),]
```
