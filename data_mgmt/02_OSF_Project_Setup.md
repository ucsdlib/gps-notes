# OSF Demo for GPS 2017

##### Lesson adapted from Jolene Esposito OSF-Curriculum

## Setting up a collaborative space

Learning objectives:

* Understand how to set up a centralized location for project storage/management.

* Understand the purpose and use of the wiki.

* Understand how the different ways folders and components can be used to organize a project.


## Materials Overview

download materials from [OSF Github repo]

## Creating a project
* We talked before about the problems that can arise when we either don’t document work, or we try and go and back document work once a study is accepted for publication. This becomes even more challenging when you have multiple collaborators, especially if they are at different institutions, and you have been sending materials back and forth by email.

* What you’ll often end up with is a very distribute network of materials, so you’ll have some things on your computer, some things in dropbox, a bunch of different version of some things going back and forth in various email threads.

* Collaborators perhaps getting out of version sync with each other…this makes it very difficult to try and go back and recreate the workflow or find particular files.

* to solve some of these problems, we’re going to set up a collaborate space for our research study using the OSF to help document and organize our research all in one place for everyone involved in the project.

* Now that you’re all signed in, you should be all be seeing the **project dashboard**.

* A **project** on the site can be anything: a lab group, an organization, a grant, a line of research, an individual experiment, etc.

## ***Activity***
Since we don’t have any projects yet, and we’re only going to be working on one research project, lets just create a project for that one study.

* Select a person in your group to create a project.

* click on the **create project** button, and give the project whatever name you like.

You can also give it a short description if you want, but you don’t have to.

* create the project

As the project creator, you should now be seeing something that looks similar to my screen.

* This is the **project overview** page.

Any project you create on the site will start out basically looking like this, and then you can customize it to fit the needs of that particular project or workflow.

The **project overview** page has a few different sections.

* **wiki** is a collaborative editing space that you can use to include important overview information about the project, things like READMEs, abstracts, research questions, outlines, etc.

* **file tree** is how you upload and navigate to files to the system; you can upload basically any type of file that you want, everything from CSVs to word documents, to power points, to image and video files.

* **Component** section is how you add additional structure and nesting to your project

* **citation widget**, which shows you the automatically generated citation for the project

* **GUID** the little 5 letter string at the end of the osf.io url.  This **entire address is a GUID, or a permanent, unique identifier.** This address has been assigned to this project page and will point back to it unless the project is deleted.

## ***Discussion***
**Question: What are collaborators/contributors seeing after typing in GUID of the project the administrator created?**

**Answer:** You should be seeing a screen telling you that you don’t have access to the project.

That’s because all projects on the OSF are set to **private** as a default.
* The administrator/creator is the only contributor on the project because they created it.

* This means that only people who have been added as **contributors** to the project have access to it and can see and/or edit it.


## ***Activity***
Since we want this to be a **collaborative project**, we need to give the other two members of your teams access to the project.

* go up to the **contributors tab** and click on that, this is how you can add people as contributors.

In this section each person is given a permission setting for access to the project.

There are three possible settings:
  * **admin** - administrator can do anything to the project and files.  Including changing permissions.

  * **read/write** - have additional capabilities to add and modify files, but they can’t change any of the settings on the project (so for example they can’t add new contributors or change the privacy settings on the project).

  * **read** - contributor can see into the project and can download any files they want, but they will not be able to add any files or modify any content.

## ***Activity***
* add your contributors/collaborators to your project.

* You can decide what level of access you want to give them, but keep in mind that later on both are going to need the ability to upload files.

* Contributors - try the GUID again, you should now be able to see the project page.

* check to make sure everyone is seeing their project page.

* go back to the project overview page.

Notice that all three people are listed as contributors on the project, and that they are all now also listed in the auto generated citation for the project.

## ***Tip***
If for some reason you wanted to give someone access to the project but did not want to give them authorship credit, just acknowledgements, you can do this by going back to the **sharing screen** and **unchecking** the **bibliographic contributor** box next to that person’s name.


# Creating a wiki

Now that you have a project and everyone has access, the first thing to do is start to write down a bit of information about the project, like why we’re doing the project, what our initial research question is, etc.

By documenting this upfront, it will be very easy for us to always go back and see how the project started out, as it evolves over the course of the research lifecycle.

In the OSF, a good place to put this type of information is in the **wiki**.

* **wiki** - a real time collaborative editor, so your whole team can work on it at once. It also can be formatted using markdown if you want to get fancy.

You get into the **wiki** by **clicking on the widget**, and then click on the **edit** button in the upper right to open up the editor.

## ***Activity***
Create wiki with a Research Question and hypothesis.

* Take a minute to set up a wiki for the project.

* Discuss amongst your group what you are interested in looking at in the dataset I given to you.

* Then collaboratively enter your research question and hypotheses, if you have them, into the wiki.

# Adding organizational structure: TIER Protocol 3.0
Right now our project is pretty flat. It is basically just one big folder with a wiki with some basic content in it.

For most projects, we’ll want to add some structure.

To do this we can follow and create the **TIER Protocol 3.0** folder structure to the project.  

or

We can also add sections to organize related files, for example we might want to organize all our data files together and separate those from files related to protocols or study materials.

For this demo we are going to add components to the project.  

In the next class you will implement the TIER Protocol 3.0.
